# Atlassian Design (atlassian.design) (on-spec)

[**View the full report**](./report.html) — one self-contained file with the score, plain-English breakdown, and screenshots; opens directly in a browser from anywhere, no other files needed.

**Score: 1.9 / 100** — 0 is fully on-spec, 100 is maximally deviant.

_This is the company's own design-system site — it should score near zero. If it doesn't, treat that as a matcher bug, not real drift._

Pages scored: 5

## Visual diagnostics

Per page: an overlay of the captured screenshot with flagged deviations boxed and color-coded by category, and a corrected render — the same page with every color/background-color/border-color/border-radius/font-family deviation patched to its nearest spec value in place (spacing, font-size, and font-weight are left alone since correcting them can reflow the layout).

## Worst offenders

_Ordered by occurrence/spread/area-boosted score, not raw normalized distance — a deviation repeated widely across the product outranks a one-off more severe one. `normalized` itself is still the raw, unboosted severity._

## Accessibility — WCAG contrast

_Separate from the deviation score above: this checks captured text against WCAG 2.1's own contrast thresholds, independent of the brand spec — an element can be on-spec and still fail contrast, or off-spec and still pass._

Checked: 190, passing: 180, failing: 10
